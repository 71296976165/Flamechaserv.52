    "I needed to clear my head." 
    "Right now I was thinking too hard." 
    "Maybe another run in the simulator."    
    "Maybe a little bit more review of the combat data." 
    "I needed to be in the hangar, alone and with something to do with my hands."
    "Something to drive away the image of that fleeting red light."
    "But when I reached the Penguin, Rosie’s loud boots clanked on the floor."

    r "Thought I might catch one of you here."
    k "Ah, Rosie. Thanks for watching my machine. Can you please -?"
    r " And let you get stuck in your thoughts? Nah, I’m dumb, not blind. I think I got an idea of what you’re thinking."
    k "What do you mean?"
    r "You’re thinking you want to beat yourself up about letting her go on alone,
        you’re thinking that if you can just work it out with your hands without thinking, the emptiness goes away."
    r "Am I wrong?"
    k "…"
    r "I knew it. You kids always think that only you can understand how you feel, but that just ain’t true."
    r "Well? Am I wrong?"
    k "N-no…"
    r "Yeap, thought so. If it helps, I’ve got a good feeling you’ll see her again."
    r "But I guess that’s not what you want to hear right now."
    r "Agh, this heart to heart stuff isn’t my thing. I’m just a big dumb lug. I ain’t smart like Grace is, ain’t as touchy-feely as Hope..."
    r "was."
    r "All I can tell you is what I see."
    r "You’re the straightforward type, liable to do whatever you wanna do without thinking."
    r "Haneko’s the type who won’t admit what she feels because she’s afraid of what happens if you say no."
    r "Tsubasa, though, she always struck me as the most trouble out of you lot."
    r "Too ready to get lost in her thoughts and act without telling anyone."
    r "Though I guess it’s a little too late to warn you about that now, isn’t it?"
    k "Yeah, it kinda is."
    r "Ha! Yeah, that sounds like me. Too slow to pick up on things when it really mattered."
    r "But maybe it wasn’t all for nothing. C’mon, sit here for a bit, lemme tell you a story."
    r "Anyone ever tell you the story about the first Flamechaser team? Back when we first discovered the YURI core?"
    k "No, not really."
    r "Figures. Grace was never good about telling people the truth."
    r "Not to other people, and especially not to herself."
    r "Too much thinking up here,"
    "She taps her head,"
    r "and not enough thinking here."
    "She taps her heart."
    r "You get what I mean?"
    k "Yeah, I think so."
    r "That’s a clever girl. Maybe you’ll have a real chance."
    r "Anyway, back to the story."
    r "We’ve just discovered the YURI core. We tried a bunch of tests on it, and found that it could produce a mysterious energy."
    r "Course, we humans can’t ever leave well enough alone, so if we can poke it, we poke it."
    r "The first Flamechasers had the strongest reactions out of the core." 
    r "Grace and Hope were obvious, but I never really figured out why I should come with."
    r "Wasn’t my idea, you know? Hope wouldn’t have it. Either we all went, or none of us went."
    r "But I guess that’s always how Hope was. The stubbornness of a devil, and the heart of an angel."
    r "Anyway, the problem was that we were all idiots."
    r "Disasters, really."
    r "Hope wouldn’t know a date if she slept with one in the same bed."
    r "Grace was so repressed and stuck there’s no way I… well. In good time."
    r "Gotta talk about how I was a fuckup who didn’t figure this all out first, you know?"
    r "But I loved ‘em. Hope was perfect in a way that didn’t seem human, but there was just something about Grace that got me."
    r "Something that made me want to do whatever I could for her, to hold her, and…"

    r "Looking back, Grace was down real bad for Hope, but that’s only something I can laugh about now, fifteen years later."
    r "I shoulda' realized that nothing good coulda' come out of asking out Grace."
    r "Girl was so, so smart but also so, so…"
    r "…"
    r "Anyway, she was real nasty about shutting me down."
    r "Things got out of hand quickly."
    r "All of our emotions started tangling in the core real quick, and the anger and the bitterness started becoming dangerous."
    r "Way Grace told it, we don’t know what happened that night."
    r "But I think we both know, and it’s just lyin’ to ourselves if we don’t admit it."
    r "That thing, it takes our emotions, makes ‘em bigger, makes ‘em real. We fed into that thing our anger and bitterness at each other,
        and it ate away at all of us and rusted our machines and {i}did{/i} something."
    r "The eggheads were happy to see something finally come out from their project, but Hope…"
    "Rosie sighs."
    r "Hope saw what was really going down, and she threw herself at the core to stop it from going out of control."
    r "I don’t know what she did." 
    r " Things were so dark, and so bleak then, and then there was a light,
        and then we were back to normal in a wrecked test site."
    r "Only… Hope wasn’t there anymore."
    r "I guess whatever the government saw there was enough to justify this sick science project continuing, even after Hope left us."
    r "And me and Grace have stuck here, trapped by Hope’s ghost, and the mistakes of our youth."
    r "So right now…"
    r "when I see the tragedy repeating itself…"
    r "I gotta say something, you know?"
    k "Yeah, I get it."

    r "Listen, kid."
    r "I think ... I think that you’ve got better instincts than I do."
    r "You kids are different. I can tell."
    r "Us old folks, we lost hope."
    r "But you, you still have that, deep in your heart."
    r "Follow that light, Karahara. Don’t hesitate, and don’t wait like Grace did. Once you know, don’t hesitate."
    r "Get on one knee."
    r "That’s the best advice I can give you."
    r "Once you can see a path in front of you, take it."
    r "I’m rooting for ya."
    r "Feeling better now?"
    k "Yeah, a lot. I know what I need to do now."
